This is Jack Yu's personal academic website, built using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. This site serves as a portfolio showcasing academic work, publications, talks, teaching, and other professional activities.

About This Template
======
This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the Academic Pages template, which is forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose. The template has been extended to support academic content including publications, talks, teaching materials, portfolio items, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.

Features
======
- **Data-Driven**: Content and metadata are stored in structured Markdown files, making it easy to manage and update
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic updates on every commit
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Academic-Focused**: Built-in support for publications, talks, teaching, and CV generation

The template also supports advanced tools like:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagramming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for interactive plotting

Getting Started
======

- `_publications/` - Research publications and papers
- `_talks/` - Conference talks and presentations
- `_teaching/` - Teaching materials and course information
- `_posts/` - Blog posts
